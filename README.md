ActionTech Repository

This project aims to provide an easy access to the products & services
cumulated in the ActionTech community in Greenpeace.

See the working demo at: [http://at-repo.gpmed.org](http://at-repo.gpmed.org)

Editing content
======

Please access [this
document](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1bPgpJht23rSr_vTawUMPfajX3eY58aLrwb_-0LnAl0U/edit#gid=1950588325)
to edit or add items. You need a @greenpeace.org email address to do so. 

After you finish the editing,
you can update the served content with clicking this link: [http://at-repo.gpmed.org/update-me](http://at-repo.gpmed.org/update-me).

If you added new image links, you need to go to
[http://at-repo.gpmed.org/update-with-images](http://at-repo.gpmed.org/update-with-images),
which takes more time to download and process the images.

Next steps
======

Please give your feedback about content structure (data fields), layout,
design, etc. to the ActionTech list.

Thanks,

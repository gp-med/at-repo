Establishing a new class of Super Lift octocopters, this modern marvel is capable of carrying over 20 lbs of payload, about a 50% increase over current Heavy Lift models. Instead of just carrying a barebone Red Epic on leading AllSteady-7 or Ronin 3-Axis Brushless Gimbals, the Infinity 9 can easily sustain heavier lenses and battery options without impacting video quality. In contrast to weak joints and hinges of typical down folding booms on smaller octocopters, the majestic Infinity 9Pro is forged from quadruple carbon decks and aircraft aluminum mechanism for twice the strength and rigidity to stop vibrations or oscillations under large payloads. A generous 5.5 feet wingspan is powered by cutting edge Tiger Motor U7 brushless motors and matching ultra stiff 17 inch carbon fiber propellers with super-strength bolsa core integration to generate unrivaled capacity and performance. As a world class developer and distributor of helicopter and multicopters, Turbo Ace offers cutting edge technology with an outstanding track record in meticulous integration and testing, on-time delivery and continued support. Fully assembled turnkey Infinity 9Pro package includes an optional integration of 3-axis brushless gimbals, GPS functions, long range pilot/cameraman transmitters and FPV live video feed. In contrast to most octocopters which are disassembled and delivered in pieces, the Infinity 9Pro structure is designed to fold and unfold within minutes for shipping and remote field operations.

As a world class developer and distributor of helicopter and multicopters, Turbo Ace offers cutting edge technology with an outstanding track record in meticulous integration and testing, on-time delivery and continued support. Fully assembled turnkey Infinity 9Pro package includes an optional integration of 3-axis brushless gimbals, GPS functions, long range pilot/cameraman transmitters and FPV live video feed.

Establishing a new class of Super Lift octocopters, this modern marvel is capable of carrying over 20 lbs of payload, about a 50% increase over current Heavy Lift models. Instead of just carrying a barebone Red Epic on leading AllSteady-7 or Ronin 3-Axis Brushless Gimbals, the Infinity 9 can easily sustain heavier lenses and battery options without impacting video quality. In contrast to weak joints and hinges of typical down folding booms on smaller octocopters, the majestic Infinity 9Pro is forged from quadruple carbon decks and aircraft aluminum mechanism for twice the strength and rigidity to stop vibrations or oscillations under large payloads. A generous 5.5 feet wingspan is powered by cutting edge Tiger Motor U7 brushless motors and matching ultra stiff 17 inch carbon fiber propellers with super-strength bolsa core integration to generate unrivaled capacity and performance. As a world class developer and distributor of helicopter and multicopters, Turbo Ace offers cutting edge technology with an outstanding track record in meticulous integration and testing, on-time delivery and continued support. Fully assembled turnkey Infinity 9Pro package includes an optional integration of 3-axis brushless gimbals, GPS functions, long range pilot/cameraman transmitters and FPV live video feed. In contrast to most octocopters which are disassembled and delivered in pieces, the Infinity 9Pro structure is designed to fold and unfold within minutes for shipping and remote field operations.

Establishing a new class of Super Lift octocopters, this modern marvel is capable of carrying over 20 lbs of payload, about a 50% increase over current Heavy Lift models. Instead of just carrying a barebone Red Epic on leading AllSteady-7 or Ronin 3-Axis Brushless Gimbals, the Infinity 9 can easily sustain heavier lenses and battery options without impacting video quality. In contrast to weak joints and hinges of typical down folding booms on smaller octocopters, the majestic Infinity 9Pro is forged from quadruple carbon decks and aircraft aluminum mechanism for twice the strength and rigidity to stop vibrations or oscillations under large payloads. A generous 5.5 feet wingspan is powered by cutting edge Tiger Motor U7 brushless motors and matching ultra stiff 17 inch carbon fiber propellers with super-strength bolsa core integration to generate unrivaled capacity and performance. As a world class developer and distributor of helicopter and multicopters, Turbo Ace offers cutting edge technology with an outstanding track record in meticulous integration and testing, on-time delivery and continued support. Fully assembled turnkey Infinity 9Pro package includes an optional integration of 3-axis brushless gimbals, GPS functions, long range pilot/cameraman transmitters and FPV live video feed. In contrast to most octocopters which are disassembled and delivered in pieces, the Infinity 9Pro structure is designed to fold and unfold within minutes for shipping and remote field operations.
